          Launching a new Django project is a simple process taking just a couple of minutes. No need to manage a web server
          or maintain a Linux machine. No need to install security patches. It just works.

          PyServe makes it easy to create and run Python programs in the cloud. You can write your programs in a web-based editor
          or just run a console session from any modern web browser. There's storage space on our servers, and you can preserve
          your session state and access it from anywhere, with no need to pay for, or configure, your own server. Start work
          on your work desktop, then later pick up from where you left off by accessing exactly the same session from your laptop.

          editor, Python 2 and 3 consoles, and a full set of batteries included. Avoid all the hassles of getting Python
          installed on everyone's laptop, and making sure everyone can pip install all the right packages.

              them more easily. You can copy files into their accounts so that you can give them a starting point for their
              assignments, and you can see their solutions.
